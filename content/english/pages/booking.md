By some miracle, his cherry tree bore fruit that midwinter Christmas day, but what happened next, when he tried to give the cherries to the King?<br/><br/>As Arthur's feast is interrupted by the arrival of a mysterious stranger, the Green Knight lays down a Christmas challenge, and Sir Gawain steps up to meet it — but at what cost to himself?<br/><br/>The mood in the court changes, and the storyteller tells a darker tale, of another a tree, under which a young woman prays that she will be blessed with a child as red as blood and as white as snow. *(If you think the Grimm Brothers’ fairy tales are just for children, then think again...)*<br/><br/>Finally, the year turns, and with it, Sir Gawain must set out on his quest to find the Green Knight and complete his challenge."
